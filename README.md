This will specifically change the locale (language and cultural conventions) for a single page on your WordPress website. More specifically, it does the following:

1. Identifies the Target Page:

    The plugin checks if the user is currently viewing a specific page based on its slug (the unique identifier in the URL). You need to replace slug-here in the code with the actual slug of your target page.

2. Changes the Locale:

    If the user is indeed on the target page, the plugin changes the website's locale to en_US. This means text displayed on that page will be in English (United States) format, including currency, dates, and other culturally relevant content.

3. No Change for Other Pages:

    Importantly, the locale change is limited to the specified target page. All other pages on your website will maintain their original locale settings.

4. Potential Use Cases:

    This plugin is useful for creating multilingual content within a single WordPress installation. For example, you might have a page targeting US visitors that needs an English locale, while the rest of your site caters to a different language.

5. Important Reminders:

    Remember to update the slug-here placeholder with the actual page slug in the plugin code.
